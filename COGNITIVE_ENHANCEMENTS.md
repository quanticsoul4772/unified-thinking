1. **assess-evidence** - Evaluate evidence quality and strength
2. **detect-contradictions** - Find contradictions across thoughts
3. **analyze-sensitivity** - Test robustness of conclusions
4. **evaluate-thinking** - Self-evaluation of thought/branch quality
5. **detect-biases** - Identify cognitive biases
6. **create-belief** - Create probabilistic belief with Bayesian updates
7. **make-decision** - Structured multi-criteria decision analysis
8. **decompose-problem** - Break down complex problems
9. **synthesize-insights** - Integrate insights across modes
10. **analyze-perspectives** - Multi-stakeholder viewpoint analysis

### Example Tool Integration Pattern

```go
mcp.AddTool(mcpServer, &mcp.Tool{
    Name:        "assess-evidence",
    Description: "Assess the quality and strength of evidence",
}, s.handleAssessEvidence)

func (s *UnifiedServer) handleAssessEvidence(ctx context.Context, req *mcp.CallToolRequest, input EvidenceRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, *EvidenceResponse, error) {
    analyzer := analysis.NewEvidenceAnalyzer()
    evidence, err := analyzer.AssessEvidence(input.Content, input.Source, input.ClaimID, input.SupportsClaim)
    // ... return formatted response
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Evidence-Based Reasoning
```go
// Create evidence analyzer
analyzer := analysis.NewEvidenceAnalyzer()

// Assess evidence
evidence, _ := analyzer.AssessEvidence(
    "A peer-reviewed study of 1000 participants shows...",
    "Journal of Research",
    "claim-123",
    true,
)
// Result: Quality = "strong", OverallScore = 0.85

// Aggregate multiple pieces of evidence
agg := analyzer.AggregateEvidence([]*types.Evidence{evidence1, evidence2, evidence3})
// Result: SupportingCount = 2, OverallStrength = 0.73
```

### Example 2: Probabilistic Reasoning
```go
// Create probabilistic reasoner
reasoner := reasoning.NewProbabilisticReasoner()

// Create belief with prior
belief, _ := reasoner.CreateBelief("It will rain tomorrow", 0.3)

// Update with evidence (Bayesian inference)
updated, _ := reasoner.UpdateBelief(belief.ID, "evidence-1", 0.7, 0.4)
// Result: Probability updated from 0.3 to 0.525

// Combine multiple beliefs
combined, _ := reasoner.CombineBeliefs([]string{belief1.ID, belief2.ID}, "and")
```

### Example 3: Bias Detection
```go
// Create bias detector
detector := metacognition.NewBiasDetector()

// Detect biases in thought
biases, _ := detector.DetectBiases(thought)
// Result: [
//   {BiasType: "confirmation", Severity: "medium", Mitigation: "..."},
//   {BiasType: "overconfidence", Severity: "low", Mitigation: "..."}
// ]
```

### Example 4: Decision Making
```go
// Create decision maker
dm := reasoning.NewDecisionMaker()

// Define decision with options and criteria
decision, _ := dm.CreateDecision(
    "Which solution should we choose?",
    options,  // [{Name: "Option A", Scores: {...}}, ...]
    criteria, // [{Name: "Cost", Weight: 0.4, Maximize: false}, ...]
)
// Result: Recommendation = "Option B (score: 0.83)", Confidence = 0.91
```
