## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
None

### Major Issues
1. **focus-branch tool failure**
   - Tool returns error when attempting to focus on a branch
   - Needs code investigation
   - Location: internal/server/server.go handleFocusBranch

### Minor Issues
1. **Prove tool limited inference**
   - Cannot prove valid syllogisms
   - Documented as implementation limitation
   - Future enhancement needed

2. **Syntax checker parentheses**
   - Does not detect unbalanced parentheses
   - Location: internal/validation/logic.go checkSyntax
   - Enhancement opportunity

## Test Coverage

### Completed
- 14/32 manual tests executed (43.75%)
- 13 tests passing
- 1 test failing (focus-branch)
- 1 implementation limitation noted

### Remaining
- 18 tests pending execution
- Focus on:
  - History and search completion
  - Branch management
  - System metrics
  - Advanced options
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue test execution from section 3.1.3 (Branch-Specific History)
2. **Fix Required**: Investigate focus-branch tool failure
3. **Optional**: Consider enhancing syntax checker for parentheses
4. **Optional**: Consider enhancing prove tool for common syllogisms

## Performance Observations

- All operations completed quickly (< 1 second response time)
- No memory issues observed
- Server stable throughout testing
- MCP protocol communication working correctly

## Recommendations

1. Complete remaining 18 tests
2. Debug focus-branch issue before production deployment
3. Document prove tool limitations in user-facing documentation
4. Consider adding parentheses checking to syntax validator
5. Continue monitoring server stability during extended testing
