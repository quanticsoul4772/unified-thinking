## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issues
**None** - All critical functionality working correctly

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

**Issue #1: Bias Detection Returns No Result (RESOLVED IN TESTING)**
- **Test**: 2.7 - detect-biases (initial), 6.8 - detect-biases (final)
- **Symptom**: Initial test returned empty result
- **Impact**: Low - Later tests showed tool working correctly
- **Root Cause**: Test thought may not have contained detectable biases
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Tool working in comprehensive integration test
- **Recommendation**: Monitor in production for edge cases

**Issue #2: Probabilistic Reasoning Intermittent Failure**
- **Test**: 2.12 - probabilistic-reasoning (retry)
- **Symptom**: Same operation that worked in Test 2.1 failed in Test 2.12
- **Impact**: Medium - reliability concern for probabilistic reasoning
- **Root Cause**: Possible session-state dependency or belief ID collision
- **Recommendation**: Review belief storage and state management
- **Workaround**: Restart server if probabilistic reasoning fails

**Issue #3: Branch Creation Parameter Ignored**
- **Test**: 3.1 - Multi-branch workflow
- **Symptom**: Custom branch_id parameter ignored; auto-generated IDs used
- **Impact**: Low - functionality works, but API behavior unexpected
- **Root Cause**: Tree mode creates branches with generated IDs
- **Recommendation**: Update documentation or implement custom branch_id support
- **Workaround**: Use auto-generated branch IDs from list-branches

### üü¢ Low Priority Issues

**Issue #4: Validation Checks Structure Only**
- **Test**: 1.9 - validate
- **Symptom**: Validates logical structure, not factual truth
- **Impact**: Very Low - this is actually correct behavior
- **Root Cause**: Design choice
- **Recommendation**: Document validation scope clearly
- **Status**: Not an issue - working as designed
