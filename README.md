# unified thinking server

a model context protocol (mcp) server that consolidates multiple cognitive thinking patterns into a single, efficient go-based implementation.

## features

### thinking modes

- **linear mode**: sequential step-by-step reasoning for systematic problem solving
- **tree mode**: multi-branch parallel exploration with insights and cross-references
- **divergent mode**: creative/unconventional ideation with "rebellion" capability
- **reflection mode**: metacognitive reflection on previous reasoning with insight extraction
- **backtracking mode**: checkpoint-based reasoning with ability to restore previous states
- **auto mode**: automatic mode selection based on input content

### core capabilities

- multi-mode thinking (linear, tree, divergent, reflection, backtracking, auto)
- branch management and exploration
- insight generation and tracking
- cross-reference support between branches
- logical validation and consistency checking
- formal proof attempts with universal instantiation

## installation

### prerequisites

- go 1.23 or higher
- git

### build

```bash
go mod download
go build -o bin/unified-thinking.exe ./cmd/server
```

or using make:

```bash
make build
```

## configuration

### basic configuration (in-memory)

add to your claude desktop config (`%appdata%\claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on windows):

```json
{
  "mcpservers": {
    "unified-thinking": {
      "command": "/path/to/unified-thinking/bin/unified-thinking.exe",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "debug": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### configuration with sqlite persistence

for persistent storage across sessions:

```json
{
  "mcpservers": {
    "unified-thinking": {
      "command": "/path/to/unified-thinking/bin/unified-thinking.exe",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "debug": "true",
        "storage_type": "sqlite",
        "sqlite_path": "c:\\users\\yourname\\appdata\\roaming\\claude\\unified-thinking.db",
        "storage_fallback": "memory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**environment variables**:
- `storage_type`: `memory` (default) or `sqlite`
- `sqlite_path`: path to sqlite database file (created automatically)
- `sqlite_timeout`: connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)
- `storage_fallback`: storage to use if primary fails (e.g., `memory`)
- `debug`: enable debug logging (`true` or `false`)

after saving the config, restart claude desktop.

### cognitive architecture

the server implements a modular cognitive architecture with specialized packages:

- **modes**: six thinking modes (linear, tree, divergent, reflection, backtracking, auto)
- **processing**: dual-process reasoning (fast intuitive vs slow deliberate)
- **reasoning**: probabilistic inference, causal analysis, temporal reasoning, abductive inference, case-based reasoning
- **analysis**: evidence assessment, contradiction detection, perspective analysis, sensitivity testing
- **metacognition**: self-evaluation, bias detection, unknown unknowns identification
- **validation**: logical validation, fallacy detection, symbolic constraint solving
- **integration**: cross-mode synthesis and emergent pattern detection
- **orchestration**: automated multi-tool workflow execution

all components are thread-safe, composable, and maintain backward compatibility.

## development

### build

```bash
# build the server binary
make build

# clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### testing

```bash
# run all tests
make test

# run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# run with coverage
make test-coverage

# run benchmarks
make benchmark
```

test coverage: >70% overall, >94% for validation package

## troubleshooting

### server won't start

1. check that go is installed: `go version`
2. verify the binary was built: check `bin/` directory
3. enable debug mode: set `debug=true` in env

### tools not appearing

1. restart claude desktop completely
2. check config file syntax
3. verify the executable path is correct

### performance issues

**in-memory mode** (default):
- data is lost on server restart
- for long sessions, consider periodic restarts
- monitor memory usage if processing thousands of thoughts

**sqlite mode** (persistent):
- data persists across restarts
- uses write-through caching for fast access
- automatic memory management via cache eviction
- enable with `storage_type=sqlite` environment variable
