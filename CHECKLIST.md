# Installation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Install Go

### Method A: PowerShell Script (Recommended)
- [ ] Open PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] Navigate to: `C:\Development\Projects\MCP\project-root\mcp-servers\unified-thinking`
- [ ] Run: `.\install-go.ps1`
- [ ] Follow the installation wizard
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Close PowerShell and open a NEW window

### Method B: Manual Download
- [ ] Visit: https://go.dev/dl/
- [ ] Download: `go1.23.4.windows-amd64.msi`
- [ ] Run the installer (use default settings)
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Close all command prompts and open a NEW one

### Verify Go Installation
- [ ] Open a **NEW** PowerShell or Command Prompt
- [ ] Run: `go version`
- [ ] Expected output: `go version go1.23.4 windows/amd64`
- [ ] If "go is not recognized", log out and log back in or restart computer

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Build Unified Thinking Server

### Option A: Use Build Script
- [ ] Open Command Prompt
- [ ] Navigate to: `C:\Development\Projects\MCP\project-root\mcp-servers\unified-thinking`
- [ ] Run: `build.bat`
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Verify: `bin\unified-thinking.exe` exists

### Option B: Manual Build
- [ ] Open Command Prompt
- [ ] Navigate to: `C:\Development\Projects\MCP\project-root\mcp-servers\unified-thinking`
- [ ] Run: `go mod download`
- [ ] Run: `go build -o bin\unified-thinking.exe .\cmd\server`
- [ ] Verify: Check that `bin\unified-thinking.exe` was created

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Configure Claude Desktop

- [ ] Locate Claude config file: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- [ ] Open it in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
- [ ] Add the unified-thinking server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unified-thinking": {
      "command": "C:\\Development\\Projects\\MCP\\project-root\\mcp-servers\\unified-thinking\\bin\\unified-thinking.exe",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- If you already have other servers, add this to the existing `"mcpServers"` object
- Make sure the path uses double backslashes: `\\`
- Verify the path matches where your executable actually is

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Test the Server

- [ ] **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (close and reopen)
- [ ] Try these test prompts:

### Test 1: Linear Mode
```
Think step by step about how to organize a large project
```
Expected: Sequential reasoning

### Test 2: Tree Mode
```
Explore multiple branches of solving climate change
```
Expected: Multiple branches with insights

### Test 3: Divergent Mode
```
What's a creative, unconventional solution to traffic congestion?
```
Expected: Creative/rebellious thinking

### Test 4: Auto Mode
```
Analyze the best approach to learn a new programming language
```
Expected: Automatic mode selection

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Go not found after installation
- [ ] Close ALL command prompts/PowerShell windows
- [ ] Open a NEW window
- [ ] If still not found, log out and log back in
- [ ] If still not found, restart computer
- [ ] Check PATH manually:
  - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
  - Verify `C:\Program Files\Go\bin` is in PATH

### Build fails
- [ ] Make sure Go is installed: `go version`
- [ ] Check you're in the right directory
- [ ] Try: `go mod tidy` then rebuild
- [ ] Check for error messages and Google them

### Server doesn't appear in Claude
- [ ] Verify `bin\unified-thinking.exe` exists
- [ ] Check config file syntax (valid JSON)
- [ ] Verify paths use double backslashes: `\\`
- [ ] Restart Claude Desktop completely
- [ ] Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### Server appears but doesn't work
- [ ] Try running manually: `.\bin\unified-thinking.exe`
- [ ] Check for error messages
- [ ] Enable DEBUG mode in config
- [ ] Check logs in Claude Desktop
